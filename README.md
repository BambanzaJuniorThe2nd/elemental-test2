# Elemental Test2

A two-page web app built with Vite, Typescript (Javascript), and Vue3

The home page, the first of the two pages, retrieves, sorts, groups by category, and displays knowledge data from http://dev3.elemental.co.za/elemental-cms/front_end/get_knowledge. The other page, on the other hand, provides a form requesting a name, email, and phone number, all of which are sent upon successful validation to http://dev3.elemental.co.za/elemental-cms/front_end/contact_form_test
